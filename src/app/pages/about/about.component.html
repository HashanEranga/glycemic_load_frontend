                Welcome to the Glycemic Load Prediction App, an AI-powered tool designed to help you understand the glycemic impact of your meals. By entering the nutritional composition of your foodâ€”such as carbohydrates, fiber, and other key nutrientsâ€”our intelligent algorithm predicts the glycemic load (GL), giving you valuable insights into how your diet may affect blood sugar levels.
                Whether you're managing diabetes, following a low-GI diet, or simply optimizing your nutrition, this app provides data-driven predictions to support informed dietary choices.
